This demo loads the global build of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [babel-standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone) from unpkg via [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) to get a development environment up and running quickly. Script compilation, including JSX, is done on the fly in the browser when scripts are loaded using `System.import`.

To run it:

```
$ npm install -g serve
$ serve .
```
