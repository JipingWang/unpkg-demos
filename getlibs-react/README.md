This demo uses the [getlibs](https://github.com/activewidgets/getlibs) script to automatically load React as a global via [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs). getlibs is interesting because it doesn't require any extra configuration; just a single `<script>` tag!

To run it:

```
$ npm install -g serve
$ serve .
```
